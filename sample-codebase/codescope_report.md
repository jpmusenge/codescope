# CodeScope Analysis Report

**Project:** sample-codebase  
**Analyzed:** 2025-12-26  
**Files Reviewed:** 4

## Summary

The analysis of the sample codebase revealed several areas of technical debt and code quality issues. Unused imports and variables, as well as commented-out code blocks, were frequent contributors to the debt.

## High Confidence Issues

- **main.py:4** - Unused import `json`.
- **main.py:5** - Unused import `datetime`.
- **main.py:8** - Variable `unused_variable` assigned but never used.
- **utils.py:4** - Unused import `re`.
- **utils.py:8** - Function `unused_function` is defined but never called.
- **utils.py:11** - Function `another_unused` is defined but never called.
- **empty_module.py** - This file is empty and serves as a placeholder.

## Medium Confidence Issues

- **utils.py:9** - Large block of commented-out code (function `commented_function`).
- **orphan.py:2** - TODO comment suggests the existence of potentially unneeded legacy code.

## Low Confidence Issues

- **orphan.py:4** - Function `legacy_code` is not called anywhere.

## Language-Specific Issues

- None identified.

## Statistics

- Unused imports: 4
- TODO/FIXME comments: 2
- Commented code blocks: 1
- Potential dead code: 2
- Language-specific issues: 0

## Top Recommendations

1. Remove unused imports and variables to clean up the code.
2. Consider deleting the empty module and orphaned files if they are not needed.
3. Review and address the TODO comments to improve project maintainability.
